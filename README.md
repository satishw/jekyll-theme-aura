## Installing Jekyll on Local System

Jekyll requires Ruby - the [official Ruby site](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) has instructions for installation. Jekyll is installed using this command in the terminal:

	gem install jekyll bundler

Next you'll need to clone the [Github repository](https://github.com/satishw/jekyll-theme-aura) to your machine.

	git clone https://github.com/satishw/jekyll-theme-aura.git

From the root directory install all the dependencies with:

	bundle install

And then run Jekyll with:

	bundle exec jekyll serve

The site can now be accessed from `http://localhost:4000/` in your web browser.

To run the validation suite:

	bundle exec jekyll build && htmlproofer --disable-external --check-html ./_site
